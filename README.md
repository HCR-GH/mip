# MemoriesInPlace
 
 This repository contains materials to power the GitHubPages website [Memories in Place](https://hcr-gh.github.io/MemoriesInPlace/)
 
 Currently the site is in a very early stage of development and largely consists of testing that things work how I want them to
 
 It will be made to look nicer in due course!
 
 Memories in Place is being created as part of my PhD research at Newcastle University in collaboration with [Remembering the Past](https://www.rememberingthepast.co.uk/)
